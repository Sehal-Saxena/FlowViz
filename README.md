# FlowViz

FlowViz is an interactive web application that visualizes network flow algorithms, specifically focusing on maximum flow and minimum cost flow problems. This project provides an intuitive interface for creating, manipulating, and analyzing network graphs.

## Features

- **Interactive Graph Creation**: Easily add nodes and edges to create custom network graphs.
- **Random Graph Generation**: Generate random graphs with specified parameters for quick testing and analysis.
- **Maximum Flow Calculation**: Visualize and calculate the maximum flow in a network.
- **Minimum Cost Flow**: Compute and display the minimum cost flow for a given required flow.
- **Path Highlighting**: Highlight specific paths, including the most optimized (maximum flow) and minimum flow paths.
- **Bottleneck Identification**: Identify and highlight bottleneck edges in the network.
- **Real-time Updates**: See flow and cost updates in real-time as you modify the graph or run algorithms.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive interface that works on desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface
- **Next.js**: As the React framework for server-side rendering and routing
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe JavaScript code
- **React Flow**: For rendering interactive node-based graphs
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsive design
